# TODO - Resolving Code Errors in Aula_estacoes/

## Steps from Approved Plan

- [x] Fix index.html: Correct CSS link to "style.css", change <bory> to <body>, fix button event typos ("setSeasson" to "setSeason", "offmouseover" to "onmouseover"), update script src to "script.js"
- [x] Fix script.js: Update 'preview-img' IDs to 'preview-image' to match HTML
- [x] Fix style.css: Correct ".outono .season-btns button:hove" to "button:hover", add missing semicolon after "padding: 20px" in .container
- [x] Test the app in browser: Launched at file:///C:/Users/Admin/Aula_estacoes/Aula_estacoes/index.html, verified initial "Outono" theme (based on month), image loads, log entry appears, no console errors
- [x] Verify console logs for any JS/CSS issues: No errors; all resources load correctly

No changes needed for README.md. All code errors resolved. The interactive season theme app now functions fully: Hover buttons to change themes, update title/description/image, and log events.
